        <p>I am Aidesiderio Alhambra. I am currently enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp at the University of California, Riverside Extention Center. I wanted to learn to be a web developer because it a challenging field. I love problem solving. In my free time, I like to play video games, graphic design, and go to the gym. I have done three Spartan races that earned me a Spartan Trifecta. I am still involved with my Boy Scout troop in San Diego. I did earn the rank of Eagle when I was younger. I am currently working at Lowe's Regional Distribution Center in Perris, CA.</p>
